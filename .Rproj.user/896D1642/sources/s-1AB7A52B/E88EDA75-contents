```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r dependencias}
library(modeldata)
library(tidyverse)
library(rsample)

data(ames)
```



# 4.1 EXPLORING IMPORTANT FEATURES

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

* When data like this is skewed in one of the tails, log trans tends to be a good idea. 

* Main drawback is that error mesaures like RMSE are not easy to intepret because they are in log too. 

```{r}
ames <- ames %>% mutate(Sale_Price = log10(Sale_Price))
```

# 5 Spending our data 

## 5.1 COMMON METHODS FOR SPLITTING DATA

```{r}
# Set the random number stream using `set.seed()` so that the results can be 
# reproduced later. 
set.seed(123)

ames_split <- initial_split(ames, prop = 0.80)

```

* `ames_split` is a rsplit objet. 

```{r}
ames_train <- training(ames_split)
ames_test  <-  testing(ames_split)

dim(ames_train)
```
